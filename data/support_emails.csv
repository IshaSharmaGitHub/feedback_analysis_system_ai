E009,Feature Request - Voice to Text,"Hi Product Team, Love your app! One feature that would make it even better is voice-to-text support. During meetings, it's difficult to type everything out, and being able to speak notes would be a game changer. Is this something you're planning to add? Thanks for considering! Best, Rachel",rachel.voicenotes@email.com,2025-12-28 15:00:00,Medium
